jSQLsh - SQLite Shell written for Jim TCL (http://jim.berlios.de/)
Lorance Stinson - Lorance Stinson AT gmail DOT com

There are things about the SQLite command shell that annoy me.
Since there are no easily modified command line SQL clients, so I wrote my
own. This is also my first foray in TCL programming.

Requires Jim TCL compiled with at least the following configuration options:
    ./configure --with-ext="readline sqlite3"

Online help is available with the '/h' command.

The file '~/.jsqlshrc' is loaded on startup.
Place custom settings here, like user macros.
This file can only contain comments '#' and '/' commands.
