=head1 NAME

jSQLsh - Jim Tcl SQLite Shell

=head1 SYNOPSIS

jsqlsh [Options] [--] <Database File>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

jSQLsh is an SQLite shell based on the PostgreSQL command line shell.
Implemented using the Jim Tcl interpreter. It is intended to be a simple light
weight SQLite shell.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 12

=item B<-a>

Enable execution of queries ending with ';'. (auto setting)

=item B<-c>

Create the database file. Fails if the file exists. Normally jSQLsh will not
open a database file that does not exist yet.

=item B<-d>

Disable slash commands and enable auto execution. Makes jSQlsh act like a dumb
SQL evaluator.

=item B<-D>

Debug mode. (Copious output!)

=item B<-h>

Display the help text.

=item B<-q>

Set quiet mode.

=item B<-s'opt=val'>

Set an option as in the '/s' command.

=item B<-->

Stops processing command line options. The next option is used as the database
file to open.

=back


=head1 PROMPT

The prompt displays several bits of useful information. A typical prompt
resembles B<DB.db (0 rows, 0 changes) #>. The database name, number of rows
returned from the last query, the number of rows changed by the last query and
the prompt setting.

=head1 COMMANDS

jSQLsh has several commands for interactive use. These are patterned after the
psql commands. All commands start with a forward slash "/". The parts in
parens "()" are optional.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

During startup, before command line options are processed, the configuration
file B<~/.jsqlshrc> is read. This file can contain any commands as noted
above. Comments denoted by B<#> and whitespace are ignored. SQL queries will
not work.

=head1 PORTABILITY

jSQLsh should work with any recent version of Jim Tcl (7 and later should be
good). Jim needs to be compiled with at least the modules B<readline> and
B<sqlite3>.
